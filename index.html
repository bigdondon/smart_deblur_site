        <p>
            Hi, I'm an engineer on computer vision field. I'm so happy to witness big progress on AI tech for computer vision. 
			Enhancefox is my first image enhancement tool based on AI technology developed by myself. 
			Based on Appleâ€™s powerful CoreML machine learning framework, I have improved some models from open source community 
			and developed this image enhancement tool that does not require networking during use. 
        </p>
		<p>
			It can improve the clarity of old photos with high operating efficiency, and is especially optimized for portraits. 
			In the future, I will continue to improve the effect of this product 
			and provide more interesting AI vision tools. Hope you all like it.
